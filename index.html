<hr>

<p>A simple solution is to traverse the linked list until you find the node you want to delete. 
But this solution requires pointer to the head node which contradicts the problem statement.</p>

<p>Fast solution is to copy the data from the next node to the node to be deleted and delete the next node;
Caution: This solution doesn’t work if the node to be deleted is the last node of the list. 
To make this solution work we can mark the end node as a dummy node.(No other option known till I code this)</p>

<a id="2-recursive-method" class="anchor" href="#2-recursive-method" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Recursive Method:</h6>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYH83T4q6Vs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYH83T4q6Vs</a>
The cool thing about recursion in this problem is that it essentially allows us to iterate through 
the linked list backwards – even though this is impossible in a singly linked list just by using the pointers 
(of course this would certainly be possible in a doubly linked list). 
The reason we can do this in recursion is because of the fact that the stack frames for each function call 
are saved until we get to the very end of the list, and then it is as if we are ‘unwinding’ the stack frames one by one going backwards in the linked list – where each stack frame essentially represents a node in the linked list. 
Make sure you understand this point, because it is important and really helps in your 
understanding of how to use recursion to solve problems.</p>

<p>Traverse the list one by one and keep putting the node addresses in a Hash Table.

<p>This solution requires modifications to basic linked list data structure.  Have a visited flag with each node.  Traverse the linked list and keep marking visited nodes.  If you see a visited node again then there is a loop. This solution works in O(n) but requires additional information with each node.
A variation of this solution that doesn’t require modification to basic data structure can be implemented using hash.  Just store the addresses of visited nodes in a hash and if you see an address that already exists in hash then there is a loop.</p>

<a id="method-3-floyds-cycle-detection-algorithm" class="anchor" href="#method-3-floyds-cycle-detection-algorithm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method 3. Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm</h6>

<p>The Tortoise (Slow ptr) and the Hare (fast ptr) start at the beginning of linked list.
For each iteration, slow ptr moves one step and the fast ptr moves two steps.
If there is a loop, fast ptr will go around the loop and meet with slow ptr.
If there is no loop, the fast prt will get to the end of the list without meeting up with the slow ptr.  </p>

<p><strong>Size-of-loop</strong>: start the slow ptr again from the current position(one step at a time) until it reaches the current position gain after completing the loop; While moving kepp the counter for counting the number of loops encountered, this counter will give the size of loop;  </p>

<p><strong>Starting point of loop</strong>: Set the slow ptr from start and fast ptr from its current position , move them both one step at a time now, until they meet at a position, this meeting point will give you the start of the loop;  </p>

<p><strong>Correctness of algorithm for finding start node of loop:</strong><br>
<em>Lets assume that linked list has a <code>non-looped</code> part of size k.</em><br>
<em>When we apply Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm, we know that after k steps,</em>  </p>

<p>-<code>slowPtr will be at start of loop, and is 0 steps into the loop.</code>  </p>

<p>-<code>fastPtr is k steps into the loop. since k might be much larger than loop_size,</code><br>
-<code>it is actually *k%loop_size*. Let’s say it as p. So fastPtr is p steps into the loop.</code>  </p>

<p>-<code>slowPtr is p steps behind fastPtr</code>  </p>

<p>-<code>fastPtr is *(loop_size – p)* steps behind slowPtr</code>  </p>

<p>-<code>fastPtr catches up to slowPtr at a rate of one step per unit of time</code>  </p>

<p>-<code>From above points, after *(loop_size – p)* steps, fastPtr and slowPtr meet each other, which means they will be p steps before start of the loop.</code><br>
-<code>Since *p = k%loop_size ( k = p+M*loop_size)*, it is correct to say that, fastPtr, slowPtr are k steps from start node of the loop.</code> 
-<code>If we reinitialise slowPtr to head node and start moving both pointers one node at a time. they both meet at start node of the loop.</code>  </p>

<p><strong>Printing the loop(trivial)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Starting from the starting point of the loop , move one step at a time equal to size-of-loop; While moving 
keep on printing the the nodes, this will give you all the  nodes in cycle;*<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This algorithm is based on Floyd‘s algorithm. It is more efficient (24-36% faster on average) than Floyd‘s but little complicated.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start ptr1 (Moving ptr), ptr2 (Stationary pointer) from beginning of the list  </p></li>
<li><p>ptr1 takes one step per iteration, If it is then at the same position as the ptr2, there is obviously a loop. If it reaches the end of the list, there is no loop.  </p></li>
<li><p>Teleport ptr2 position to ptr1 position occasionally. We start out waiting just 2 steps before teleportation, and we double that each time we move the ptr2.  </p></li>

3) Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 – c2).
4) Now traverse the bigger list from the first node till d nodes so that from here onwards both the lists have equal no of nodes.
5) Then we can traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across a common node.

<pre><code>1. Traverse the first linked list(count the elements) and make a circular linked list. 
   (Remember last node so that we can break the circle later on).
2. Now view the problem as find the loop in the second linked list. So the problem is solved.
3. Since we already know the length of the loop(size of first linked list) we can traverse those many number of nodes in second list, and then start another pointer from the beginning of second list. we have to traverse until they are equal, and that is the required intersection point.
4. remove the circle from the linked list.

<p>A simple solution is to use a stack of list nodes. This mainly involves three steps.
1) Traverse the given list from head to tail and push every visited node to stack.
2) Traverse the list again. For every visited node, pop a node from stack and compare data of popped node with currently visited node.

<p><strong>To divide the list in two halves</strong>  </p>

<p><em>When number of nodes are even, the first and second half contain exactly half nodes.</em><br>
<em>The challenging thing in this method is to handle the case when number of nodes are odd.</em><br>

<li><em>The idea is to use function call stack as container.</em></li>
<li><em>Recursively traverse till the end of list.</em></li>
<li><em>When we return from last NULL, we will be at last node.</em></li>
<li><em>The last node to be compared with first node of list.</em></li>
<li>
<em>In order to access first node of list, we need list head to be available in the last call of recursion.</em> </li>
<li>
<em>Hence we pass head also to the recursive function. If they both match we need to compare (2, n-2) nodes.</em> </li>

<p><code>However, the trick in identifying double pointer. Passing single pointer is as good as pass-by-value, and we will pass the same pointer again and again. We need to pass the address of head pointer for reflecting the changes in parent recursive calls.</code></p>

1. Take a vari­able int carry =0.<br>
2. Initialize Node newHead = null; and Node curr = null.<br>
3. newHead will be the starting node of our result linked list and curr node will the reference to the current node on which we are working in our result linked list.<br>
4. Navigate Both the lists simultaneously taking one node at a time.<br>
5. Add the data of nodes and carry , say you call this as total.<br>
6. Check if total &gt;=10, if yes put carry =1 and total=total-10.<br>
7. create a new node with value total, say you call it as Node ‘n’.<br>
8. check if newHead is null, if yes then and assign ‘n’ to newHead. Now our starting node of result linked list is fixed.<br>
9. if newHead is not null then add ‘n’ to the result linked list with the help of newHead and curr.<br>
10. Now repeat steps 4 to 9 till any one of the list gets over( considering both the list has different length, if both list has the same length then both lists gets over at the same time, you will not need step 11).<br>
11. Now navigate the list ( whichever is remain­ing) and add it to the result list. (take care of the carry, see Exam­ple). You can avoid this step by making sure that both the list has the same length adding 0 at the end of the shorter list , to see the similar implementation click here.<br>
12. At the End check the carry, if it is not 0, create a new node with value 1 and add it to the result linked list.       </p>

<hr>

<p>Two Linked Lists are identical when they have same data and arrangement of data is also same. 
<em>For example Linked lists a (1-&gt;2-&gt;3) and b(1-&gt;2-&gt;3) are identical.</em>
Write a function to check if the given two linked lists are identical.</p>

<p><em>Method 1 (Iterative)</em>
To identify if two lists are identical, we need to traverse both lists simultaneously, and while traversing we need to compare data.</p>

<p><em>Method 2 (Recursive)</em>
Recursive solution code is much cleaner than the iterative code. 
You probably wouldn’t want to use the recursive version for production code however, 
because it will use stack space which is proportional to the length of the lists</p>

<p><em>Time Complexity: O(n) for both iterative and recursive versions. n is the length of the smaller list among a and b.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).</em></p>

<p><code>Example:</code>
<code>Inputs:  1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 3</code>
<code>Output:  3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;NULL.</code></p>

<p><code>Inputs:   1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;80-&gt;NULL and k = 5</code>
<code>Output:  5-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;6-&gt;NULL.</code> </p>

<p><strong>Algorithm: reverse(head, k)</strong>
1. Reverse the first sub-list of size k. While reversing keep track of the next node and previous node. Let the pointer to the next node be next and pointer to the previous node be prev. See this post for reversing a linked list.<br>
2. head-&gt;next = reverse(next, k) /* Recursively call for rest of the list and link the two sub-lists <em>/<br>
3. return prev /</em> prev becomes the new head of the list */   </p>

<hr>

<p>Given a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s, sort it.</p>

<p><strong>Following steps can be used to sort the given linked list.</strong>
1. Traverse the list and count the number of 0s, 1s and 2s. Let the counts be n1, n2 and n3 respectively.<br>
2. Traverse the list again, fill the first n1 nodes with 0, then n2 nodes with 1 and finally n3 nodes with 2.   </p>

<hr>

<p>Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every alternate k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in an efficient way. 
Give the complexity of your algorithm.</p>

<p><code>Example:</code>
<code>Inputs:   1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;9-&gt;NULL and k = 3</code>
<code>Output:   3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;9-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;NULL.</code> </p>

<p><strong>Method 1 (Process 2k nodes and recursively call for rest of the list)</strong> 
This method is basically an extension of the method discussed in this post.</p>

<p><strong>kAltReverse(struct node *head, int k) Time Complexity: O(n)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li> Reverse first k nodes.<br>
</li>
<li> In the modified list head points to the kth node.  So change next<br>
   of head to (k+1)th node<br>
</li>
<li> Move the current pointer to skip next k nodes.<br>
</li>
<li> Call the kAltReverse() recursively for rest of the n - 2k nodes.<br>
</li>
<li> Return new head of the list.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>*<em>Method 2 (Process k nodes and recursively call for rest of the list) *</em>
The method 1 reverses the first k node and then moves the pointer to k nodes ahead. 
So method 1 uses two while loops and processes 2k nodes in one recursive call.
This method processes only k nodes in a recursive call. 
It uses a third bool parameter b which decides whether to reverse the k elements or simply move the pointer.</p>

<p><strong>_kAltReverse(struct node *head, int k, bool b) Time Complexity: O(n)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li> If b is true, then reverse first k nodes.<br>
</li>
<li> If b is false, then move the pointer k nodes ahead.<br>
</li>
<li> Call the kAltReverse() recursively for rest of the n - k nodes and link
   rest of the modified list with end of first k nodes.<br>
</li>
<li> Return new head of the list.<br>
</li>
</ol>
